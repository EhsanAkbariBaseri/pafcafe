It also offers a Question & Answer ( which has subtle differences with forums ) similar to StackOverFlow with some major enhancements and uses an awesome User-Interface which uses Bootstrap with some edtions.

##How to use this service?
You could signup in Pafcafe easily with an genuine email , which is needed for account verification . Pafcafe is free and always would be. In fact, I'm of the opinion that all the softwares should be open-source ;)

##How to use this source?
You could clone ( download ) the source via either Git or Download Zip option and have it on your local PC.
After making desired changes in the source you could run the server with command below :

   $ rails s
   
or more verbosely:

   $ rails server
   
Here I am assuming you have rails gem and all its dependencies installed,though.

Although I haven't written the test modules yet ( I wanted this project running as soon as possible ), you could run your own tests with: 

   $ rails t
   
which is equivalent to :

   $ rails test
